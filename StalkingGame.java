/*	This class will contain main logic of game
StalkingGame extends Table, this is a special type of Actor that has a funky setClip(true) function,
it means that anything outside the bounds of the TrafficGame won't be drawn. 
Remember that we don't allow the aspect ratio to be stretched, 
clipping means we won't have actors spilling out over our nice black letterboxing bars. 
I think this is probably abusing tables, it's no doubt not what they were really meant for, 
but I think it's a great little hack and am more than happy with the results!
